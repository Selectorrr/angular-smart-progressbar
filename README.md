# smart-progressbar.js
This is a very smart progress bar, which itself decides when it appears depending on the load.

## Usage
Download ***smart-progressbar.js*** manually or install with bower
```bash
$ bower install smart-progressbar -S
```  
Include ***smart-progressbar.js*** ( or ***smart-progressbar.min.js***) in your website.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/smart-progressbar/smart-progressbar.min.js"></script>
```

Set ***smart-progressbar*** as a dependency in your module

    var app = angular.module('app', ['smart-progressbar']);
    
## That's it!
